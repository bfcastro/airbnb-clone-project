# airbnb-clone-project

## Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a full-stack web application inspired by Airbnb’s core features.  
The goal of this project is to replicate essential functionality such as user authentication, property listings, reservations, and search capabilities — while learning how to design, develop, and deploy modern web applications.  

This project is intended for educational purposes and serves as a hands-on way to practice frontend, backend, and database integration skills.

## Project Goals
- Recreate a functional clone of Airbnb’s platform with core booking features.  
- Build a scalable and modular codebase following best practices.  
- Practice full-stack development with modern tools and frameworks.  
- Learn deployment workflows and hosting for production-ready applications.  

## Tech Stack

- Html, CSS, Javascript (React or similar framework)

Version Contro
- Git & Github  

Design Tools
- Figma for UI/ UX Design   

## Features (Planned / Implemented)
- User authentication (sign up, login, logout)  
- Create and manage property listings

## UI/UX Design Planning 
Design Goals
- Provide a clean and intuitive interface for seamless property browsing and booking.
- Ensure responsive design across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

- Booking and reservation system

Key Features to Implement
- Search & Filter: Quickly find properties based on location, price, or amenities.
- Property Cards: Highlight essential details (image, price, location, availability).
- Detailed View: Show full property information, image gallery, and booking options.
- Checkout Flow: Simple and secure process to confirm bookings.
- Responsive Design: Smooth experience across all screen sizes.

Why User-Friendly Design Matters
A booking system must be simple and trustworthy. Clear layouts and smooth flows reduce drop-offs, 
build confidence, and increase completed bookings.

#Importance of Identifying Design Properties in Mockups
Defining design properties (colors, typography, spacing, layouts) in mockups ensures consistency, scalability, and developer clarity. 
Without a clear style guide, each page might look different, leading to a poor user experience. 
By identifying these properties early:
- Developers can translate designs into code accurately.
- The product maintains a consistent brand identity.
- Future updates are faster and easier since reusable design rules already exist.
